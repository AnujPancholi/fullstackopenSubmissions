# Part 0
For this part, exercises 0.1-0.3 are *not* to be submitted to Github, so they are not included.

For exercises 0.4-0.6, each exercise is submitted in its own directory, with the following naming convention:

> exercise-<exercise number with '.' replaced with underscore>-<exercise text with spaces replaced by underscore>

For example, for 0.4, which was described on the course website as "0.4: new note", so, the name for its directory would be "exercise-0_4-new_note".

Yes, it's bizarre, but it's the best I could come up with for part 0.

Since the exercises for these parts involve making sequence diagrams via websequencediagrams.com, each directory will contain 2 things:

1. A png file of the required diagram.
2. A txt file with the text that was used to generate said diagram on websequencediagrams.com
